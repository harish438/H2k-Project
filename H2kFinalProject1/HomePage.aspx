        <li>Our project starts from this page.</li>
        <li>This project is mainly about creating a small website by using different topics like concept of Master pages, Session State, Javascript validation, Sql database etc. </li>
        <li>By the end of this project my goal is to learn the basic idea of user controls and validation controls and how to use stored procedures.</li>
        <li>First we will create all the seperate pages by using webforms.</li>
        <li>Then create a masterpage by choosing which areas should be repeaed when events are clicked.</li>
        <li>Next we should create tables in database and should connect by using Sql Server.</li>
        <li>In the meanwhile process we should take care of validation controls by using Javascript.</li>
